## The Case for "No Impact, No Feedback"

This article argues that much of the feedback we give is unnecessary, and can even be detrimental. It advocates for a "no impact, no feedback" approach.

The author came to this realization after recognizing that a significant portion of their own feedback stemmed from personal discomfort with different working styles, rather than actual performance deficiencies.

The proposed solution is to evaluate feedback based on its measurable impact in one of three key areas:

*   **Work Outcomes:** Does the behavior demonstrably affect the quality or efficiency of the work?
*   **Team Collaboration:** Does the behavior hinder effective teamwork and communication?
*   **Creation of a Hostile Environment:** Does the behavior create a negative or unwelcoming atmosphere?

The article posits that giving feedback based on mere preferences leads to:

*   **Feedback Fatigue:** Employees become overwhelmed and desensitized to feedback.
*   **Reduced Psychological Safety:** Employees become hesitant to express themselves or take risks.
*   **Diminished Value of Diverse Perspectives:** Employees feel pressured to conform, stifling creativity and innovation.

Instead, managers should focus their feedback on addressing behaviors that genuinely impact team objectives. Crucially, they must also manage their own discomfort with differing styles. Understanding that diversity is beneficial when everyone contributes effectively is key to fostering a high-performing and inclusive environment.
