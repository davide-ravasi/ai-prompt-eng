# Step-by-Step LLM Color Matcher Tutorial

This directory contains a step-by-step tutorial to build the LLM color matcher from scratch. Each step builds upon the previous one, so you can understand and test every functionality.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

- **15-minute sessions** - Each step is designed to be completed in about 15 minutes
- **Incremental building** - Each step adds new functionality
- **Test as you go** - Every step includes testing functionality
- **Understand everything** - No black boxes, you'll see exactly how everything works

## 📋 Step Overview

### Step 1: Basic Setup and Dependencies ✅

- Check if all required libraries are installed
- Test basic pandas functionality
- Verify API key setup
- **File:** `01_basic_setup.py`
- **Test:** `python step_by_step/01_basic_setup.py`

### Step 2: LLM Setup (Coming Next)

- Configure Google Gemini API
- Test basic LLM communication
- Create simple prompts

### Step 3: Reading Excel Files

- Read reference color files
- Read target color files
- Handle different file formats

### Step 4: Color Matching Logic

- Create prompts for color matching
- Handle LLM responses
- Parse JSON results

### Step 5: Output Generation

- Create output Excel files
- Add confidence levels
- Add reasoning

### Step 6: User Interface

- Create interactive prompts
- Handle user input
- Error handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Run Step 1:**

   ```bash
   python step_by_step/01_basic_setup.py
   ```

2. **If successful, you'll see:**

   ```
   ✅ Step 1 completed successfully!
   Ready to move to Step 2: LLM Setup
   ```

3. **If there are issues, fix them before continuing**

## 📝 Notes

- Each step file can be run independently
- You can modify and experiment with each step
- The final result will be the same as the complete LLM color matcher
- Take your time to understand each piece before moving to the next
